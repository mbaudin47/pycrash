\section{New sequential algorithms}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[containsverbatim]
\frametitle{OpenTURNS: estimate the mean sequentially}

Two sequential algorithms based on asymptotic statistics: the mean 
and Sobol' sensitivity indices.


Part 1 : Estimate the mean with an sequential algorithm.
\begin{itemize}
\item The "classical" way of estimating the mean : set the sample size $n$, 
then use the sample mean $\bar{\mu} = (1/n) \sum_{j=1}^n y^{(j)}$ and 
estimate the accuracy (e.g. C.V.).

\item Goal: use the smallest possible sample which achieves 
a given accuracy. Increase the sample size until a stopping criteria is met.

\item The sample mean is asymptotically gaussian:
$$
\bar{\mu} \xrightarrow{D} \mathcal{N}\left(E(Y),\frac{V(Y)}{n}\right).
$$

\item The absolute accuracy of the estimate $\bar{\mu}$ can be evaluated based on the sample
standard deviation of the estimator $\hat{s} / \sqrt{n}$ 

\item To get good performances on distributed supercomputers and 
multi-core workstations, the size of the sample increases by block.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\note{
I would now like to introduce two new sequential algorithms which are new in OT 1.12. 

These algorithms are based on asymptotic statistics. 

Part 1 is on estimating the mean and part 2 is on sensitivity indices. 

Suppose that you want to estimate the mean of a random variable $Y$, where 
$Y$ is the output of a computer code. 

Assume that there is only one single output (it is easy to generalize this 
to multiple outputs).

	\end{center}
	
\end{columns}

}



\end{frame}

\note{
We use the ExpectationSimulationAlgorithm class. 

We set the setMaximumOuterSampling to 1000 (one thousands). This is the 
number of outer iterations. 

We set the setBlockSize to 10 (ten). This is the 
block size (i.e. the number of inner iterations). 

To define the stopping criteria, we set the setMaximumCoefficientOfVariation 
to 0.001 (point zero zero one). 

And we run. 

The getResult method returns an object that contains the result of the 
algorithm. 
The getExpectationEstimate returns the estimated mean. 

Most importantly, the getExpectationDistribution method returns the gaussian 
distribution, that we can plot. 
We can, if required, derive a 95\% confidence interval. 
}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[containsverbatim]
\frametitle{OpenTURNS: estimate Sobol' indices sequentially}

Part 2 : Estimate Sobol' sensitivity indices with an incremental algorithm 
based on asymptotic statistics, extending the work of (Janon et al., 2014).
\begin{itemize}
\item Assume that the Sobol' estimator is:
$$
\bar{S} = \Psi\left(\overline{U}\right)
$$
where $\Psi$ is a multivariate function, $U$ is a multivariate sample and $\overline{U}$ is its 
sample mean. 

\item Each Sobol' estimator (e.g. Saltelli, Jansen, etc...) 
can be associated with a specific choice of function $\Psi$ and vector $U$. 

\item Therefore, the multivariate delta method implies:
$$
\sqrt{n} \left(\overline{U} - \mu\right) \xrightarrow{D} \mathcal{N}\left(0,\nabla \psi(\mu)^T \Gamma\nabla \psi(\mu)\right)
$$
where $\mu$ is the expected value of the Sobol' indice, $\nabla \psi(\mu)$ is the 
gradient of the function $\Psi$ and $\Gamma$ is the covariance matrix of 
$\overline{U}$. 

\item An implementation of the exact gradient $\nabla \psi(\mu)$ was 
derived for all estimators in OpenTURNS (Dumas, 2018).  

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\note{
We did the same to estimate the sensitivity indices. 

The trick is to define the Sobol' estimator as follows ... 
where $\Psi$ is a multivariate function, 
$U$ is a multivariate sample and $\overline{U}$ is its 
sample mean.

Asymptotic distribution of the first order Sobol' indices for the first variable.

\end{frame}


\note{
We use the SaltelliSensitivityAlgorithm class to define the 
sensitivity estimator. 

The sequential algorithm is provided by the SobolSimulationAlgorithm class. 

We set the setMaximumOuterSampling, which is the number of outer 
iterations. 

We set the block size with setBlockSize (i.e. the size of the 
inner iterations). 

Then the setIndexQuantileLevel sets the confidence interval level 
and the setIndexQuantileEpsilon sets the confidence interval length. 

The purpose of the \pyobj{batchsize} parameter is to send feedback to the 
user more often. 
Two feedback systems are available: the progress callback allows to send 
information from the algorithm to the user in order, e.g. 
to update a progress bar; the stop callback allows to send information back 
from the user to the algorithm so that we can stop the algorithm when required, 
e.g. with a stop button in a graphical user interface. 
Evaluating the design of experiments associated with just one 
single block requires \pyobj{blocksize*(nx+2)} evaluations, 
where \pyobj{nx} is the number of input variables. 
However, there are particular uses of the OpenTURNS library where 
we want to get a regular feedback from the algorithm. 
In the specific example of the graphical user interface presented, 
a progress bar informs the user of the 
progression of the algorithm. 
If the \pyobj{blocksize} parameter was the only one available to the user, 
the user would get a feedback only each \pyobj{blocksize*(nx+2)} evaluations. 
Instead, everytime a new batch has been evaluated, the progress and stop callbacks 
are evaluated so that the graphical user interface can be updated.

one evaluation of the function is then a trajectory which depends on the time.

To analyze these trajectories requires more advanced tools than with

PERSALYS Roadmap : 
\begin{itemize}
\item Calibration
\item 2D Fields, 3D Fields
\item In-Situ fields based on the MELISSA library (with INRIA): 
when we cannot store the whole sample in memory or on the hard drive, 
update the statistics (e.g. the mean, Sobol' indices) sequentially, 
with distributed computing. 
\end{itemize}

\note{
We are currently working on adding features to perform 
the calibration of a computer code (almost done). 

The next features we plan to add to PERSALYS are the management 
of 2D and 3D stochastic fields. 

We also work on the use of the MELISSA software which performs 
in-situ studies. 

This library allows to perform UQ studies in situations 
where we cannot store more than a couple of multidimensional fields 
in memory or on the hard drive.

Part 2 : Estimate Sobol' sensitivity indices with an incremental algorithm.
\begin{itemize}
\item Let us denote by $\Phi_k^F$ (resp. $\Phi_k^T$) the cumulated 
distribution function of the gaussian distribution of the first (resp. total) 
order sensitivity indice of the k-th input variable.

\item We set $\alpha\in[0,1]$ a quantile level and $\epsilon \in(0,1]$ a quantile precision. 

\item The algorithms stops when, on all components, first and total order 
indices haved been estimated with enough precision.
 
The precision is said to be sufficient if 
$$
\Phi_k^F(1-\alpha) - \Phi_k^F(\alpha) \leq \epsilon

$$
\Phi_k^T(1-\alpha) - \Phi_k^T(\alpha) \leq \epsilon

\item From scratch : 3 inputs, 2 outputs, sum, central dispersion study with default parameters
\item Open axialStressedBeam-python.xml : central dispersion with sample size 1000, Threshold P(G<0) with CV=0.05
\item Import crue-4vars-analytique.py : S.A. with sample size 1000, sort by size

\frametitle{UQ, the easy way}

Main goal : make UQ easy to use
\begin{itemize}
\item classical user-friendly algorithms with a 
state-of-the-art implementation,
\item default parameters of the algorithms whenever possible,
\item an easy access to the HPC resources,
\item an automated connection to the computer code.
\end{itemize}

Produce standard results :
\begin{itemize}
\item numerical results e.g. tables,
\item classical graphics.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Overview (1/2)}

Inputs from the user :
\begin{itemize}
\item Physical model : symbolic, Python code or SALOME component
\item Probabilistic model : joint probability distribution function of the input.
\end{itemize}

Then :
\begin{itemize}
\item Central dispersion: estimates the central dispersion of the output Y (e.g. mean).
\item Threshold probability: estimates the probability that the output exceeds a given
threshold S.
\item Sensitivity analysis: estimates the importance of the inputs to the variability of the output.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Overview (2/2)}

Probabilistic modeling :
\begin{itemize}
\item Distribution fitting from a sample
\item Dependence modeling (Gaussian copula)
\end{itemize}

Meta-modeling :
\begin{itemize}
\item Polynomial chaos (full or sparse)
\item Kriging
\end{itemize}
