\section{Convergence in distribution}

\begin{definition}
(\emph{Convergence in distribution})
Assume that $X_1,X_2,...$ is a sequence of real-valued random variables 
with cumulative distribution functions $\{F_n\}_{n\geq 0}$. 
Assume that $X$ is a real-valued random variable 
with cumulative distribution function $\{F\}_{n\geq 0}$. 
The sequence $X_n$ converges in distribution to $X$ if:
$$
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} F_n(X_n)=F(x).
$$
for any $x\in \RR$ at which $F$ is continuous.
In this case, we write:
$$
X_n \xrightarrow{D} X.
$$
\end{definition}

The following theorem gives an example of such convergence. 

\begin{theorem}
(\emph{Maximum of uniform random numbers})
Assume that $X_1,X_2,...$ are independent random numbers such that $X_n\sim U(0,1)$. 
Let $Y_n$ be the maximum:
$$
Y_n = \max_{1\leq i\leq n}  X_i.
$$
Therefore the sequence $Y_n$ converges in distribution to an exponential random variable, i.e.:
$$
n(1-Y_n) \xrightarrow{D} \mathcal{E}(1).
$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

\section{Delta method}

\begin{theorem}
(\emph{Delta-method})
Assume that $X_1,X_2,...$ is a sequence of real-valued random variables 
so that 
$$
\sqrt{n} (X_n - \theta) \xrightarrow{D} \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2).
$$
Assume that $g$ is a real function. 
Let $\theta\in\RR$ and suppose that $g'(\theta)$ exists and that $g'(\theta)\neq 0$. 
Therefore, 
$$
\sqrt{n} (g(X_n) - g(\theta)) \xrightarrow{D} \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2 g'(\theta)^2).
$$
\end{theorem}
