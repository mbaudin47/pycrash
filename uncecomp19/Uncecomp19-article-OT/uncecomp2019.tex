\abstract{ This document provides information and instructions for preparing
a paper to be included in the Proceedings of the 3$^{rd}$ ECCOMAS Thematic
Conference on Uncertainty Quantification in Computational Sciences and
Engineering (UNCECOMP 2019). The paper can be written in LaTeX or Word.
The first page is reserved for the title of the paper, the authors,
affiliation, key words and the Abstract. The introduction must begin at
the top of the second page. All the instructions as well as the source
for the example files for LaTeX or Word can be found in the website of the
Conference.}

\begin{document}

\section{INTRODUCTION}

The proceedings will be edited using Portable Document Format (PDF),
will be available online and at the ECCOMAS website and also will be 
indexed in SCOPUS database with link to the full text in PDF. 
The paper should be written following the format of the LaTeX or Word macros 
for submission that can be found on the Conference website: 
\url{http://2019.uncecomp.org/}. 
\textbf{The file has to be translated to Portable Document Format (PDF) before 
submission. Authors must upload the PDF file, correctly formatted, on the 
Conference website}.
The deadline for uploading the full-length paper is given at the conference 
website. The organ-izers do not commit themselves to include in the 
Proceedings any paper received later than this deadline. \textbf{At least 
one of the authors must register and pay his/her registration fee before 
the deadline for their paper to be included in the final program of the 
Conference}.

\section{GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS}

The paper must be written in English within a printing box of 16 cm x 24 cm,
centered in the page. There is no limitation regarding the number of pages of
the final contribution. Nevertheless, only full papers with 6 pages or more
(including figures, tables and references) will be indexed in \textbf{SCOPUS}.

\section{TITLE, AUTHORS, AFFILIATION, KEYWORDS}

The first page must contain the Title, Author(s), Affiliation(s), Keywords
and the Abstract. The second page must begin with the Introduction. The first
line of the title is located 3 cm from the top of the printing box.

\subsection{Title}

The title should be written centered, in 14pt, boldface Roman, all capital
letters. It should be single spaced if the title is more than one line long.

\subsection{Author}

The author's name should include first name, middle initial and surname. It
should be writ-ten centered, in 12pt boldface Roman, 12pt below the title.

\subsection{Affiliation}

Author's affiliation should be written centered, in 11pt Roman, 12pt below
the list of authors. A 12pt space should separate two different affiliations.

\subsection{Keywords}

Please, write no more than six key words, which will be used to compile the
CD-ROM index. They should be written left aligned, in 12pt Roman, and the line
must begin with the words \textbf{Key words:} boldfaced. A 30pt space should
separate the key words from the affiliations.

\subsection{Abstract}

Use 12pt Italic Roman for the abstract. The word \textbf{Abstract} must be set
in boldface, not italicized, at the beginning of the first line. The abstract
text should be justified and separated 12pt from the keywords, as shown in the
first page of these instructions. The abstract should neither be too short nor
exceed the first page.

\section{HEADINGS}

\subsection{Main headings}

The main headings should be written left aligned, in 12pt, boldface and all
capital Roman letters. There should be a 12pt space before and 6pt after the
main headings.

\subsection{Secondary headings}

Secondary headings should be written left aligned, 12 pt, boldface Roman, with
an initial capital for first word only. There should be a 12pt space before and
6pt after the secondary headings.

\section{EDITORIAL HEADING}

The first page will include the Editorial Heading, as shown in the first page
of these instructions. In addition, successive pages will include the name of
the authors. The Editorial Heading must be included in the paper by the authors.

\section{TEXT}

The normal text should be written single-spaced, justified, using 12pt (Times
New) Roman in one column. The first line of each paragraph must be indented
5 mm. There is not inter-paragraph spacing.

\section{PAGE NUMBERS}

A paper will be found in the CD-ROM by the author's name or using the keywords.
The Proceedings of the Conference will be also available in the ECCOMAS website
and will be indexed in SCOPUS database with link to the full text in PDF. The
final e-book with the Proceedings will have its own page numbers, and as a result
the authors should NOT include page numbers in their papers.

\section{FIGURES}

All figures should be numbered consecutively and captioned. The caption title
should be written centered, in 10pt Roman, with upper and lower case letters.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=16cm]{figure}
    \caption{Page layout.}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

A 6pt space should separate the figure from the caption, and a 12pt space should
separate the upper part of the figure and the bottom of the caption from the
surrounding text.

Figures should be included within the text rather than added at the end of the
paper.

\section{EQUATIONS}

A displayed equation is numbered, using Arabic numbers in parentheses. It should
be centered, leaving a 6pt space above and below to separate it from the surrounding
text.

The following example is a single line equation:
\begin{eqnarray}
  Ax = b
\end{eqnarray}

The next example is a multi-line equation:
\begin{eqnarray}
  Ax = b \\
  Bx = c \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

\section{TABLES}

All tables should be numbered consecutively and captioned, the caption should
be 10pt Roman, upper and lower case letters.

\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{*{3}{c}}
    \hline
    Title 1 & Title 2 & Title 3 \\
    \hline
    C21 & C22 & C23 \\
    C31 & C32 & C33 \\
    C41 & C42 & C43 \\
    C51 & C52 & C53 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\caption{Example of the construction of one table.}
\end{table}
A 6pt space should separate the table from the caption, and a 12pt space should
separate the table from the surrounding text.

\section{FORMAT OF REFERENCES}

References should be quoted in the text by numbers \cite{Zienkiewicz,Oden}
and grouped together at the end of the paper in numerical order as shown in
these instructions.

\section{REVIEW}

Peer-review under responsibility of the organizing committee of UNCECOMP 2019.
